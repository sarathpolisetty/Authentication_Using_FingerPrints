# Authentication_Using_FingerPrints
Reading Finger prints and storing them in the database 
is the major part that have to be concentrated when working on any projects regarding fingerprints.


# Reading FingerPrints
Reading fingerprints can be done using different types of fingerprint sensors like morphos, r30x sensors etc which are widely available in the market.
Let us see how to read fingerprints using r30x fingerprint sensor.

# Reading fingerprints using r307 fingerprint sensor
Sensors or any other application oriented electronic devices can be operated only through connecting them to a physical programmable circuit board which has a software support used to write and upload computer code to the physical board




Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board
